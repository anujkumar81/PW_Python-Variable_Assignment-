    "Snake Case: Variable names are generally written in snake_case, which means words are separated by underscores. For example: my_variable, count, result.\n",
    "Avoiding Single Letter Variable Names: Variable names should be meaningful and not overly short or ambiguous. \n",
    "                Single letter variable names, like x, y, or z, should generally be avoided, unless used as loop iterators or for other specific purposes.\n",

    "                 caused by uninitialized variables.\n",

    "             guidance to other developers who may use or modify the code.\n",
    "Avoiding Global Variables: Global variables should be minimized as they can lead to confusion and make code harder to maintain.\n",
    "              It's generally recommended to use local variables within functions or classes, and pass them as arguments if needed.\n",
    "Naming Conventions for Constants: Constants, which are variables whose values should not change during the execution of the program,\n",
